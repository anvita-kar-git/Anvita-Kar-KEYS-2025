## Assignment 1: Internship Description 

My PI is Dr. Tyson Lee Swetnam, and along with being affiliated with KEYS and BIO5, he is the Research Associate Professor of Geoinformatics at The University of Arizona and the Director of Open Science in the Institute for Computation and Data-enabled Insight. Dr. Swetnam is a prominent researcher in the field of cyberinfrastructure and geospatial sciences. Our lab is focused on successfully establishing an MCP (Model Context Protocol) for researchers to share, import, and sort their data. I specifically am working on the ability to get a vibe coding platform set up on the cloud. We are trying to help groups of researchers access data more efficiently and create an open source Anthropic AI platform where productivity will be the number one goal for all users.
