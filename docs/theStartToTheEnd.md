## Everything that happened from the start to the end in my summer at KEYS 2025
Large Language Models (LLMs) have tremendous potential for academic research, but their impact is limited because of poor connectivity with specialized research tools. Recent work on LLM-database integration has established foundational principles, but frameworks that combine Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Artificial Intelligence LLMs are largely nonexistent.

During my time with KEYS – while working in Dr. Tyson Swetnam’s laboratory – we set out to find the answer to the question “How can Model Context Protocol integrations with state-of-the-art LLMs be optimized to create comprehensive research workflows that enhance knowledge discovery, database interaction, and collaborative documentation in academic research environments?” Much more simply, we wanted to see the increase in efficiency that researchers could receive, just by using AI in their work.

The study was a comparative analysis examining research workflows before and after MCP integration. The "Before MCPs" condition involved traditional research where scientists would conduct experiments, manually enter data into databases, organize data for analysis using external applications, and later collect the analyzed data for presentation. The "After MCPs" condition greatly streamlined the process by allowing scientists to access applications that directly moved from data collection to analysis and presentation.

The MCP-enhanced workflows demonstrated significant improvements in research efficiency as expected, proving our hypothesis to be correct. Initial testing suggested these AI integrated research tools could dramatically improve research productivity because of seamless access to diverse data sources and applications. Any framework created based on this idea is anticipated to provide researchers with unprecedented analytical capabilities and collaborative AI partners.

This work represents a crucial step toward realizing the full potential of AI as a research partner in academic inquiry. The findings may revolutionize research by creating more powerful, interconnected research environments that transform how researchers collaborate with AI systems
