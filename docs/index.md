## About
Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in academic research, but are limited due to poor integration with frameworks that combine Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Artificial Intelligence LLMs. Our study compared research workflows before and after MCP integration. The "Before MCPs" condition included scientists conducting experiments, manually entering data, organizing data for external applications’ analysis, and collecting the data for presentation. The "After MCPs" condition was streamlined; scientists used applications moving directly from data collection to analysis and then presentation. MCP-enhanced workflows were infinitely more efficient – suggesting these AI integrated tools could improve research productivity by accessing diverse databases and applications. These findings are crucial for full potential interaction with AI in  research through creating powerfully interconnected work environments.


My PI is Dr. Tyson Lee Swetnam, and along with being affiliated with KEYS and BIO5, he is the Research Associate Professor of Geoinformatics at The University of Arizona and the Director of Open Science in the Institute for Computation and Data-enabled Insight. Dr. Swetnam is a prominent researcher in the field of cyberinfrastructure and geospatial sciences. Our lab is focused on successfully establishing an MCP (Model Context Protocol) for researchers to share, import, and sort their data. I specifically am working on the ability to get a vibe coding platform set up on the cloud. We are trying to help groups of researchers access data more efficiently and create an open source Anthropic AI platform where productivity will be the number one goal for all users.

### Main Project

My lab’s research investigates how LLMs1 can be enhanced with MCP2 connections to create powerful research tools that hopefully revolutionize academic inquiry and discovery. The work focuses on integrating LLMs1 with PostgreSQL3 databases, and text mining capabilities via Weaviate4 MCP2 connections. In simpler terms, this project is like teaching super-smart computer assistants to connect with different databases and research tools effectively, so they can help scientists find information, discover new patterns, and document their work more effectively than ever before.


### Results

The MCP-enhanced workflows demonstrated significant improvements in efficiency as expected. Initial testing suggested these AI integrated tools could improve research productivity through seamless access to diverse databases and applications. Any framework created with this idea anticipates providing researchers with unprecedented analytical capabilities and AI partners.
This work represents a crucial step toward realizing the full potential of AI as a research partner in academics. These findings may revolutionize research by creating powerful, interconnected research environments that transform how researchers collaborate with AI.
