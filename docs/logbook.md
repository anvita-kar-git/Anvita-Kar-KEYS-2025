Date written in YYYY-MM-DD format
The Daily Logs are short (5-6 sentence) summaries of my daily activities that include:
(1) what was the plan?
(2) what actually happend?
(3) what could I have done better?
(4) how I will approach this differently next time? 

### _[Training Week: 2025-06-02 to 2025-06-06]_

Throughout Training Week, we were prepped to meet our labs and given a basic idea of what to expect by the KEYS staff and crew. I learnt a lot about bionformatics, AI and data science, with different professors and presenters.

### _[Day 1: 2025-06-09]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm

Today the first thing I worked on was my KEYS [Assignment #1: Internship Description](assignment1.md). Then I logged into [Cyverse](https://de.cyverse.org/apps) and learnt about my discovery environment. I launched a shell workspace and practiced some basic bash code, to see how it worked and what the outputs looked like. Then I connected with a friend from keys who I relaised was working in the same lab I was. I helped him learn some of the things I had learnt already and we decided to work together so we could help each other. I installed VScode on my laptop and started exploring its abilities. We both learnt how to connect VScode to our GitHub repositories. I also set up Cline - an opensource coding AI assistant - in VScode, and configured GitHub Copilot, both to help me code in the future. I wasn't sure how to check my MCP extension, but with some help I realised it was already set up. We were told by our PIs, to create a Google AI Studio account so we could access Gemini and create API keys. I created an account but quickly found out that we weren't given permission to generate API keys. Later I was told of an alternative by my PI. Then I read a website about vibe coding, because that is what my lab was going to be focused on for now. I also read another website on prompt engineering, both of which were suggested by my mentor, and finally wrote my log for the day.
