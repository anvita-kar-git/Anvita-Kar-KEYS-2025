(4) how I will approach this differently next time? 

## Week 1
### _[Training Week: 2025-06-02 to 2025-06-06]_
Throughout Training Week, we were prepped to meet our labs and given a basic idea of what to expect by the KEYS staff and crew. I learnt a lot about bionformatics, AI and data science, with different professors and presenters.


## Week 2
### _[Day 1: 2025-06-09]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
Today the first thing I worked on was my KEYS [Assignment #1: Internship Description](assignment1.md). Then I logged into [Cyverse](https://de.cyverse.org/apps) and learnt about my discovery environment. I launched a shell workspace and practiced some basic bash code, to see how it worked and what the outputs looked like. Later I connected with a friend from KEYS who I realised was working in the same lab I was. I helped him learn some of the things I had learnt already and we decided to work together so we could help each other. I installed VScode on my laptop and started exploring its abilities. We both learnt how to connect VScode to our GitHub repositories. I also set up Cline - an opensource coding AI assistant - in VScode, and configured GitHub Copilot, both to help me code in the future. I wasn't sure how to check my MCP extension, but with some help I realised it was already set up. We were told by our PIs, to create a [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) account so we could access Gemini and create API keys. I created an account but quickly found out that we weren't given permission to generate API keys. Later I was told of an alternative by my PI. Then I read a website about [vibe coding](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/vibe/), because that is what my lab was going to be focused on for now. I also read another website on [prompt engineering](https://github.com/saishsw/KEYS-2025/blob/main/docs/promptengineeringexamples.md), both of which were suggested by my mentor, and finally wrote my log for the day.

### _[Day 2: 2025-06-10]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
Started the day visiting the website of the KEYS Webinar speaker for tommorrow, [Dr. Vignesh Subbian](https://healthseil.github.io/). Then I was told to install 2 [MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) in VScode, which actually took most of the day, because of the absolutely innumerable number of errors that came through. Yeah, I spent about 4 hours on getting the 2 MCPs - File System and Fetch - set up. We worked on making Gemini APIs accesible to me and a friend in the same lab, we would later find out that it expired very quickly and was impractical to use. We instead used [Verde APIs](https://chat.cyverse.ai/courses/course_cugob4crr77s73eu4aog/apikey) to do our work. At the end I had to make some manual configurations to the code produced by the AI I was using, Cline, so that I could get File System and Fetch set up. After finally getting the 2 MCPs installed, I took a break from facing the errors and revisited the websites on [prompt engineering](https://github.com/saishsw/KEYS-2025/blob/main/docs/promptengineeringexamples.md) and [vibe coding](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/vibe/). They were in depth lessons that I will probably come back to tommorrow as well. About an hour later, I moved on to working with the 2 APIs by following an example excercise in [Map-Making 101](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/tutorials/publichealth/gis/). This came with its own , albeit more manageble, errors. Halfway through the instructions, the CyVerse Workspace I was working on crashed. I lost all of my data and work that I had spent the last 6 hours working on :( . I yelled a little bit if I'm being honest, but when I started all over again, it was easier and faster since I knew what to do already. I bypassed all the errors and learnt from my mistakes - screenshotting all the edits I made to the code so I could help my teammate get to the same place I was. I encountered my final error when the code turned out to be fine, but as I hosted my Map on GitHub Pages, a 404 error would show up. That's where I stopped for the day and decided to come back to it with more vigor tommorrow.

### _[Day 3: 2025-06-11]_ (8:00 am - 12:30 pm KEYS seminar) 1:30 pm to 5:30 pm 
First thing in the morning I attended a KEYS science seminar with science literacy lessons and guest speaker [Dr. Vignesh Subbian](https://healthseil.github.io/). Then I had my KEYS crew meeting till 1:30 and got started on work after. First I had a meeting with an undergraduate student working in my lab, and he introduced me to an application I was going to use called [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate). After the meeting I worked on what I had left unfinished yesterday and I finally got past all the errors, getting my Map-making 101 website to work flawlessly. Then I went back and finished reading the 2 about websites that I have been reading bit by bit for the last 2 days, wrote my logbook, and checked out.

### _[Day 4: 2025-06-12]_ 8:00 am to 5:00 pm
Today was a little bit slower than the rest, I worked on my research poster and the assignments due KEYS for most of the time. We had to write about our research and its purpose, working on the nitroduction section of our poster. I had some difficulty figuring out what my project was going to be on, but after some communication with my PI, I had a better idea of where to start. Then I worked on setting up weaviate, which I was newly intoduced to and faced many problems. I realised that I actually didn't have the best idea of what I was doing with the lab, so I requested a meeting with them and that was the end of the day. 

### _[Day 5: 2025-06-13]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
After realising that I didn't know a lot about what I was doing, I decided to pause the coding for a while and read about the applications I was working with. I read about [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) which was the main application I would be working with and coding in with my lab. I read about the application that my PI had made called the [Cyverse](https://learning.cyverse.org/). I read quite a few websites about Weaviate, since it seemed to be what I was struggling to get set up, including it's [official MCP server page](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@weaviate/mcp-server-weaviate), it's [Quickstart](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart) page, and a few other websites suggested by my lab mentor. Then I had a meeting with my PI and lab mentor who gave me some more things to do. Then I tested the set up of weaviate on VScode and realised that Weaviate could not be fully functional on a web browser based environment. This pushes my need to instal docker on my loaner laptop from the University of Arizona. However because I donthave admin access, I have to contact IT and have them remotely set it up. That...might take a while.... So I got to work on creating something else that my PI had told me to do. I have to make a new part in my KEYS website where I write down instructions, ideas, or comprehensive material regarding my project, that can help "teach" students that use what I make. That's where I stopped today, I might work on it during the weekend, happy Friday!!


##  Week 3
### _[2025-06-16 to 2025-06-20 (Exception of Thursday 06-19 for Juneteenth]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
This week went by pretty quick, I didn't do a lot of reproducible work and we had Thursday off because UofA was celebrating Juneteenth. I mostly just read A LOT about the things I would use throughout the summer on websites like . . . [https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/prompt-engineering/](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/prompt-engineering/), [https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e50638/](https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e50638/), [https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vibe-coding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vibe-coding), [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41019-023-00235-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41019-023-00235-6), [https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-postgresql-introduction](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-postgresql-introduction), [https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/), [https://www.researchwithrutgers.com/en/publications/how-should-the-advancement-of-large-language-models-affect-the-pr#](https://www.researchwithrutgers.com/en/publications/how-should-the-advancement-of-large-language-models-affect-the-pr#), [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0144929X.2024.2431068](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0144929X.2024.2431068). I also read a lot from my PI's website about [Generative AI & Prompt Engineering](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/).

On Monday I made mermaid diagrams for my website and decided to use one on my research poster. I used Gemini to create the base code, but there were many errors so I had to learn how to make one myself and fix all those errors. I used the official [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) website, and edited 2 mermaid diagrams which continued into Tuesday. I was invited to a github repositpry relating to a future project that i would be working on with my PI [(https://github.com/tyson-swetnam/techlaunch-car)](https://github.com/tyson-swetnam/techlaunch-car) and explored that on Tuesday. On Wednesday I worked on setting up a data store MCP looking at a powerpoint presentation from [Illyong Choi](https://github.com/iychoi) a student at the University of Arizona about [AI Verde MCP Server: Bridging Generative AI with CyVerse Data Resources](docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xzzUmb52yJO8elCvsk6cC88U-yiSb8bh). With that and working on my KEYS assignments, Friday went by pretty quick.


## Week 4
### _[Day 1: 2025-06-23]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
Start of the week I checked up on my KEYS assignments and looked at what I needed to do for the week. This week we had to present results on our KEYS poster. Instead, I worked on my website, learning how I could make it more professional. I read the documentation for markdown language in mkdoks from its website, [https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference), and edited my assignments accordingly. After that I looked for images for my research poster. I had to ask for permission to use a picture form [Descope's](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/mcp) Website. I also used a picture from the powerpoint presentation I followed last week, by [Illyong Choi](https://github.com/iychoi). I edited the text in my introduction making it less text heavy and keeping the Key Terms and definitions in the front. Later, I looked back at what I was working on the previous week. I was trying to think of a way to [embedd Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded) into cyverse, maybe as an mcp that the user would install. But halfway through, I had a meeting with my PI and he said to let that go for now, and that we would work on it later. I moved away from that and worked on getting my local VScode set up. I got most of the way through it but realised that I had to install node.js into my computer so I could use it. I wrote a ticket to UofA IT and that was the end of the day.

### _[Day 2: 2025-06-24]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
I started the day on Tuesday by going into a cyverse server and installing Filesystem and Fetch MCPs. It took lesser time than usual because I was already familiar with what to type in and where to edit the code so that the 2 MCPs would install instantly. I was told by my PI to find the installation path for cline in the VScode server through Cyverse, and I had to test a bit to figure that out. I tried opening a new server but Cyverse Discovery Environment kept erroring out. I asked my PI and we realised that there was a faulty server somehwere, and all our requests we being taken there. So we decided to overload that server with requests, so that cycerse would have to put us on a good server. I could only start up to 2 analyses at a time, so my PI was more effective, but eventually it did start working. I worked with it for a little while longer to figure out the installations code for cline, which I eventually found and delivered. I also had to find the configurations for the newly sdded Claude code in VScode servers across cyverse. I got access to a new project with  my PI that was about a react app that he was making. My task is to access and host that react app on a webpage opened through Cyverse VScode, with the use of a proxy.

### _[Day 3: 2025-06-25]_ (8:00 am to 12:30 pm KEYS Seminar) 2:00 pm to 
Wednesday's are seminar days. We had a KEYS Science seminar from 8 am to 12:30 pm. The presenters were previous KEYS alumini, and they presented their research posters while talking about their time at KEYS in the years before us. It was a very informative session, they were able to shed some light on what to do for research oppurtunities after KEYS and how it helped them progress in their professional lives. After the seminar I had a meeting with one of the main KEYS Staff, Jordan who helped me go over the changes on my poster and reiterate some ideas for what my results would look like. I got to working on the changes they suggested and finished as much as I could.

### _[Day 4: 2025-06-26]_ 8:00 am to 5:00 pm
I started warking on hosting the new project ["TechLaunch Car"](https://github.com/tyson-swetnam/techlaunch-car/) in VScode. I cloned the git repository and found out that all the proxy networks were connected to a file called "vite.config.ts". I edited that file with the help of cline and used CLaude to understand what some of the code meant. I first noticed a lot of errors regarding which coding model to use. VScode was configured to use either Mamba or Conda, and my server, despite having mamba installed would not pick it up. The error messages would say that neither conda nor mamba were detected. I worked on fixing that for a while and when I finally got it to work another error popped up. The proxy wouldn't connect to the website, specifically the frontend one. The backend proxy seemed to be working fine, but the frontend proxy would put up a blank page or a 504 gateway. I saw a 404 error occasionally, and even a connection error that said "socket hang up". After a meeting with my PI, I was told to leave working with the TechLaunh project for now and focus on creating my own react app. 

### _[Day 5: 2025-06-27]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
Today was slow, I worked on updating my logbook since I was a little behind this week. I tried to work in cyverse and continue fiding the path for my customized MCP server file, but the Cyverse VScode server seemes to be down, I could'nt get anything working. I then worked on my KEYS research poster. I completely changed the arrangemt of almost everything based on the advice of my crew leader and worked on making flowcharts. I also inserted images thinking about how interactive and visually appealing I could make it. I decided to remove teh mermaid diagram I previously had in my materials and methods section.
