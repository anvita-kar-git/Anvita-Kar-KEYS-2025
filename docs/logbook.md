# Logbook

Date written in YYYY-MM-DD format
The Daily Logs are short (5-6 sentence) summaries of my daily activities that include:
(1) what was the plan?
(2) what actually happend?
(3) what could I have done better?
(4) how I will approach this differently next time? 

### _[Training Week: 2025-06-02 to 2025-06-06]_
Throughout Training Week, we were prepped to meet our labs and given a basic idea of what to expect by the KEYS staff and crew. I learnt a lot about bionformatics, AI and data science, with different professors and presenters.

### _[Day 1: 2025-06-09]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
Today the first thing I worked on was my KEYS [Assignment #1: Internship Description](assignment1.md). Then I logged into [Cyverse](https://de.cyverse.org/apps) and learnt about my discovery environment. I launched a shell workspace and practiced some basic bash code, to see how it worked and what the outputs looked like. Then I connected with a friend from keys who I realised was working in the same lab I was. I helped him learn some of the things I had learnt already and we decided to work together so we could help each other. I installed VScode on my laptop and started exploring its abilities. We both learnt how to connect VScode to our GitHub repositories. I also set up Cline - an opensource coding AI assistant - in VScode, and configured GitHub Copilot, both to help me code in the future. I wasn't sure how to check my MCP extension, but with some help I realised it was already set up. We were told by our PIs, to create a [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) account so we could access Gemini and create API keys. I created an account but quickly found out that we weren't given permission to generate API keys. Later I was told of an alternative by my PI. Then I read a website about [vibe coding](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/vibe/), because that is what my lab was going to be focused on for now. I also read another website on [prompt engineering](https://github.com/saishsw/KEYS-2025/blob/main/docs/promptengineeringexamples.md), both of which were suggested by my mentor, and finally wrote my log for the day.

### _[Day 2: 2025-06-10]_ 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
Started the day visiting the website of the KEYS Webinar speaker for tommorrow, [Dr. Vignesh Subbian](https://healthseil.github.io/). Then I was told to install 2 [MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) in VScode, which actually took most of the day, because of the absolutely innumerable number of errors that came through. Yeah, I spent about 4 hours on getting the 2 MCPs - File System and Fetch - set up. We worked on making Gemini APIs accesible to me and a friend in the same lab, we would later find out that it expired very quickly and was impractical to use. We instead used [Verde APIs](https://chat.cyverse.ai/courses/course_cugob4crr77s73eu4aog/apikey) to do our work. At the end I had to make some manual configurations to the code produced by the AI I was using, Cline, so that I could get File System and Fetch set up. After finally getting the 2 MCPs installed, I took a break form facing the errors and revisited the websites on [prompt engineering](https://github.com/saishsw/KEYS-2025/blob/main/docs/promptengineeringexamples.md) and [vibe coding](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/vibe/). They were in depth lessons that I will probably come back to tommorrow as well. About an hour later, I moved on to working with the 2 APIs by following an example excercise in [Map-Making 101](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/tutorials/publichealth/gis/). This came with its own , albeit more manageble, errors. Halfway through the instructions, the CyVerse Workspace I was working on crashed. I lost all of my data and work that I had spent the last 6 hours working on :( . I yelled a little bit if I'm being honest, but when I started all over again, it was easier and faster since I knew what to do already. I bypassed all the errors and learnt from my mistakes - screenshotting all the edits I made to the code so I could help my teammate get to the same place I was. I encountered my final error when the code turned out to be fine, but as I hosted my Map on GitHub Pages, a 404 error would show up. That's where I stopped for the day and decided to come back to it with more vigor tommorrow.
