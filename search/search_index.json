Recent work on LLM-database integration has established foundational principles, but frameworks that combine Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Artificial Intelligence LLMs are largely nonexistent.</p> <p>During my time with KEYS \u2013 while working in Dr. Tyson Swetnam\u2019s laboratory \u2013 we set out to find the answer to the question \u201cHow can Model Context Protocol integrations with state-of-the-art LLMs be optimized to create comprehensive research workflows that enhance knowledge discovery, database interaction, and collaborative documentation in academic research environments?\u201d Much more simply, we wanted to see the increase in efficiency that researchers could receive, just by using AI in their work.</p> <p>The study was a comparative analysis examining research workflows before and after MCP integration. The \"Before MCPs\" condition involved traditional research where scientists would conduct experiments, manually enter data into databases, organize data for analysis using external applications, and later collect the analyzed data for presentation. The \"After MCPs\" condition greatly streamlined the process by allowing scientists to access applications that directly moved from data collection to analysis and presentation.</p> <p>The MCP-enhanced workflows demonstrated significant improvements in research efficiency as expected, proving our hypothesis to be correct. Initial testing suggested these AI integrated research tools could dramatically improve research productivity because of seamless access to diverse data sources and applications. Any framework created based on this idea is anticipated to provide researchers with unprecedented analytical capabilities and collaborative AI partners.</p> <p>This work represents a crucial step toward realizing the full potential of AI as a research partner in academic inquiry.

We worked on making Gemini APIs accesible to me and a friend in the same lab, we would later find out that it expired very quickly and was impractical to use.

After finally getting the 2 MCPs installed, I took a break from facing the errors and revisited the websites on prompt engineering and vibe coding. They were in depth lessons that I will probably come back to tommorrow as well. About an hour later, I moved on to working with the 2 APIs by following an example excercise in Map-Making 101.

I lost all of my data and work that I had spent the last 6 hours working on :( . I yelled a little bit if I'm being honest, but when I started all over again, it was easier and faster since I knew what to do already. I bypassed all the errors and learnt from my mistakes - screenshotting all the edits I made to the code so I could help my teammate get to the same place I was. I encountered my final error when the code turned out to be fine, but as I hosted my Map on GitHub Pages, a 404 error would show up.

Prompt Engineering is the skill of crafting clear, effective instructions for Aritficial Intelligence systems. I have taken a particular liking to using Claude AI and Gemini, but there are many different AIs you can work with, like Chat GPT, Perplexity, and even GitHub Copilot.  Instead of just prompting \"write me a story,\" a good prompt engineer might say \"write a 500-word mystery story set in 1920s Paris, told from the perspective of a detective who speaks in short, clipped sentences.\" The better your prompt, the better results you'll get from the AI.</p>"},{"location":"promptengineering/#heres-a-few-things-i-learnt-by-prompting-everyday","title":"Here's a few things I learnt by Prompting everyday...","text":"<p>Specificity matters enormously. Instead of \"write a report,\" try \"write a 2-page executive summary analyzing PostgreSQL sales data, highlighting the top 3 growth opportunities and 2 main challenges, formatted with bullet points and aimed at daily consumers.\"</p> <p>Context shapes everything. Providing background information, your role, the intended audience, and desired outcome helps the AI understand not just what you want, but why you want it. \"I'm a high school student preparing a lesson on AI for other students\" will get you very different content than \"I'm a Univesity intern researching the use of Artificial INtelligence in Research for a presentation to PHD holders.\"</p> <p>Examples are incredibly powerful. Showing the AI what good output looks like through examples (few-shot prompting) often works better than lengthy descriptions. If you want a specific writing style, provide a sample paragraph.</p> <p>Iterative refinement is normal. Prompt engineering isn't about getting it perfect on the first try - most of the time you start with a decent prompt and refine it based on what you get back. Maybe you need to add constraints, clarify tone, or provide more context.</p> <p>Structure and formatting help. Using clear sections, asking for step-by-step thinking, or requesting specific output formats (like JSON, tables, or numbered lists) can dramatically improve results.</p>"},{"location":"promptengineering/#vibe-coding","title":"Vibe Coding","text":"<p>\"\u201cVibe coding\u201d is introduced by renowned Computer scientist  Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 and emphasized the significance of AI tools in software development. This concept is in line with developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude and OpenAI's Codex to help developers stay in the zone of creativity and automate coding works\" Harkar, S (2025) [2]</p> <p>A more relaxed, intuitive approach to programming where you focus on getting something that works rather than writing perfect, optimized code. It's about coding based on what information you currently have - maybe you're not sure of the exact syntax, but you write something that captures the general idea and then iterate until it works. I think of it as the programming equivalent of humming a tune you can't quite remember until it sounds right. It's especially popular when prototyping or when you just want to quickly test an idea without getting bogged down in best practices.</p> <p>I've been using a specific coding tool named Cline which I access through a platform called VScode, and write code with it to complete projects.</p> <pre><code>      graph TD\n    %% --- Style Definitions ---\n    classDef redTheme fill:#E56B6F,stroke:#D90429,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    classDef orangeTheme fill:#FFB703,stroke:#FB8500,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    %% ADDED: Style for the invisible spacer nodes\n    classDef spacerTheme fill:transparent,stroke:transparent,stroke-width:0px\n\n    %% --- Chart Structure ---\n    A(When User Has An Idea Or A Goal:)\n\n    subgraph \"Prompt Engineering: The Art of Instruction\"\n        %% ADDED: Invisible spacer node for top padding\n        PE_Spacer( )\n        B([\"Craft a Prompt\"])\n        C1[\"&lt;b&gt;1.
